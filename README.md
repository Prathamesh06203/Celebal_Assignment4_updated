Introduction
In this phase, we carried out various data preprocessing steps to clean and transform the dataset. This includes handling missing values, identifying outliers, and encoding categorical variables to make the data suitable for analysis.

Dependencies
To run the preprocessing script, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
Data Preprocessing Steps
Handling Missing Values
In the preprocessing script, we handled missing values by:

Checking for NaNs in each column.
Implementing various strategies such as mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, and forward/backward fill.
Identifying and Addressing Outliers
We identified outliers using:

Statistical methods like IQR (Interquartile Range).
Addressed them through winsorization or removal.
Encoding Categorical Variables
We converted categorical variables to numeric using:

One-Hot Encoding for transforming categorical variables into binary columns.
Label Encoding for converting categories into numerical labels.
Files
The project includes the following key files:

data_preprocessing.py: The Python script that contains the data preprocessing code.
your_dataset.csv: The dataset used for preprocessing.
Usage
To preprocess your dataset:

Ensure your dataset (your_dataset.csv) is in the root directory.

Run the preprocessing script:

bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
This script will generate a cleaned and preprocessed dataset as your_processed_dataset.csv.
